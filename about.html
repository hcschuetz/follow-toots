  <h1>Follow Toots - About</h1>

  <h2>What is this good for?</h2>
  <p>
    Occasionally you see a toot on mastodon and you are interested
    in the (direct and indirect) answers to that toot.
    Somebody might have asked an interesting question and you want to see the
    answers given by other users.
    Or somebody makes a joke and you expect funny replies.
    Or ...
  </p>
  <p>
    Mastodon clients display the current "toot tree".
    If you want to see future replies, you can open the toot in a
    separate browser tab and reload it occasionally.
    But then you have to search the tree manually for new toots,
    which soon becomes tedious.
  </p>
  <p>
    This application makes it more comfortable to "follow" a toot,
    or actually the replies to it.
  </p>
  <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
  <p>
    If you want to follow a toot, copy its URL to the field
    "URL of a toot to follow" in the <a href=".">overview page</a>
    and add it to your list of followed toots.
    (This could be made more convenient if your favorite Mastodon client
    provided a button or link to automate this.
    But you can get similar convenience by using the bookmarklet provided on
    the <a href="config.html">configuration page</a>.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Select one of the list entries to see the corresponding tree.
  </p>
  <p>
    Initially all the toots in a tree are open.
    You can close the toots you have already read
    by clicking the "−" button.
    When you reload the tree, closed toots remain closed.
    Any new toots will be open.
    This way you find new replies quickly without the need
    for searching through a tree again and again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the application state is persisted by your browser.
    It survives closing and re-opening the pages or even a browser restart.
  </p>

  <h2>More Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The application does not poll for tree updates regularly.
      You have to click a "reload" button to get the latest data.
    </li>
    <li>
      On the other hand, reloads from one page (for example a tree page)
      will also be used by other pages (such as the overview page).
    </li>
    <li>
      You can view the descendants of a toot in hierarchical mode (as a tree)
      and in chronological mode (as a list).
      There is also a mode where you only see the root toot
      and any toots you have not yet closed.
      <br>
      By the way, the hierarchical view detects threads and displays them
      without indentation but with numbered toots.
    </li>
    <li>
      The toot display does not yet support all the possible features of a toot,
      but it should cover the most important cases.
    </li>
  </ul>
